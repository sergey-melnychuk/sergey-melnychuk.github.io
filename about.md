I am a Software Development Engineer (as you might have already guessed).

I build, test, deploy and run software.

I know how to ship containers as well as scale up and out.

I write code in Java, Scala, C/C++, Go, Rust and JavaScript.

I design web pages in HTML and CSS.

I know algorithms to sort things, find things, traverse trees and graphs.

I know Dijkstra, Tarjan, Kruskal, Prim and more famous surnames.

I know how to implement membership and quorum protocols among connected nodes.

I know how to learn machine to detect if there's a cat on the picture.

I know how deep learning can be and how large CNNs and RNNs can grow.

And I know a lot more things, but those above excite me the most.
