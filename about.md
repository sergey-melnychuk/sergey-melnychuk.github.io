I'm a Software Development Engineer (as you might have already guessed).

I build, test, deploy and run software.

I write code in Java, Scala, C/C++, Go, Rust and JavaScript.

I design web pages in HTML, CSS.

I know algorithms to sort things, find things, traverse trees and graphs.

I know Dijkstra, Tarjan, Kruskal, Prim and more famous surnames.

I know how to implement gossip, membership, quorum and replication protocols among connected nodes.

I know how to make machine to learn to detect if there's a cat on the picture.

I know how deep learning can be and how large CNNs RNNs can grow.
