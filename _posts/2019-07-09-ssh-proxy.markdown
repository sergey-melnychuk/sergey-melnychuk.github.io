Providing an SSH access to a home server (usually hidden behind NAT) from outside world (Internet) sounds like a tricky task to configure. But it is not, literally 2 commands and a VPS witn public IP is enough to do that.

I will need following:
- Instances
  - VPS with public `$IP`
  - `home` server
  - `away` client
- SSH keys
  - `tunnel_rsa` to access VPS from `home`
  - `key_rsa` to access `home` from `away`

On `home` instance, this command connects to `$IP` (VPS) and spawns there a listening at port 2222 reverse proxy connection back to `home`. This can run in background.

```bash
# home
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/tunnel_rsa -R 0.0.0.0:2222:localhost:22 $IP -N
```

Now from `away` instance, SSH-ing to reverse proxy connection will let us to connect to `home` instance. Easy and securely.

```bash
# away
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/key_rsa key@$IP -p 2222
```

Nice!
