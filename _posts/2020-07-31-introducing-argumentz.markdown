Every now and then there is a need to pass arguments to the command-line application. While there are a lot of libraries/frameworks to do that in Java, I still had this feeling "why such an easy thing must be so cumbersome and require so much boilerplate?".

So I decided: the world needs one more command-line arguments parser for Java. Why? Well, maybe just because I can! First thing to decide on a new project is a name: 'argumentz' was available (according to maven central and one poppular web search engine). 'Z' in 'Argumentz' stands for the last letter in the alphabet: I wanted to make the library as simple as possible (but not simpler) and keep user in the total control, so there cannot be anything simpler beyond it (like there are no (known) letters after Z).
